The Portable Embosser Format (PEF) is an award winning data format for representing braille books, accurately and unambiguously; regardless of language, location, embosser settings, braille code and computer environment. It can be used for braille embossing and archiving anywhere in the world, no matter where nor how it was produced.

PEF builds on XML, Unicode and Dublin Core. Three well known, widely used and reliable technologies.
